Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
a) Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. 
b) It’s important because software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) The Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): Structured programming emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a response to the challenges of managing complex software systems. This paradigm emphasised the use of control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines, which helped reduce the complexity of code and made it more readable and maintainable.
b) The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software development in the 1980s by introducing the concept of encapsulating data and behaviour into objects. Pioneered by languages like Smalltalk and later popularised by C++ and Java, OOP allowed developers to model real-world entities more naturally. The key concepts of OOP—encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism—enabled better code reuse, modularity, and scalability. 
c) The Agile Manifesto and the Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001): The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marked a significant shift in software development practices. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emerged as alternatives to traditional, rigid development models like Waterfall. Agile emphasises iterative development, customer collaboration, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b) Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c) Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d) Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
e) Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
f) Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a) Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach where each phase of the development lifecycle—requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance—must be completed before the next begins, Once a phase is completed, it is generally not revisited. This makes it difficult to make changes once the project is underway. Examples: Government or Defense Projects,Construction Projects.
c) Agile breaks the project into small iterations or sprints, with continuous feedback and improvements, Agile embraces change, allowing for adjustments in requirements even late in the development process.
While Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation, essential documentation is still maintained, continuous feedback from stakeholders ensures that the product aligns with customer needs. Examples: Startups, Software Development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) A Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b) A Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c) A Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) Integrated development environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (example: Visual Studio Code, Bracket).
b) Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (example: Git).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
b) Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
c) Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
b) Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
c) System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
d) Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
e) Testing is important in quality assurance because it’s a critical aspect in software development as it measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a) Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statement to get the best possibles responses from AI models
b) Prompt engineering helps avoid user asking AI models vague questions and getting confusing answer by making questions clear and specific, so AI Models understand what we are asking.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a) Vague Prompt: Write a code to show sum of numbers
b) Improved Prompt: Write a code in python that prints the sum of 3 numbers?
c) Improved prompt is good cause it help us get the right response from the AI models we using.
